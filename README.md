# graph_modeling
A program made to create 2D mathematical graphs (i.e. nodes and vertices). Made in Javascript, CSS, and a little html. To run, clone the repository, then launch the graph.html file. The program will launch in your default web browser. 

Here are some examples. There are also example files in the corresponding directory.

The save feature is still quite buggy, and I would use it at your own risk.
